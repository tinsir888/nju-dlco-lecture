# NJU-DLCO-lecture

My solutions for [DLCO(Digital Logic and Computer Organization) lecture](https://nju-projectn.github.io/dlco-lecture-note/) labs of NJU-ProjectN.

**Due to the plan in YSYX, there's no need to finish lab 4, 5, 10, 11, 12.**

DLCO is the bridging course for Project YSYX.

Each lab eventually runs on NVBoard(another sub-project of NJU-ProjectN), a virtual FPGA.

## Environment

- Linux
- NVBoard
- Verilator
- sdl...

## How to Run

In each subfolder
- `make sim` to generate executable file on NVBoard
- `./build/($EXE_FILENAME)` to run the file on NVBoard.
