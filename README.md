# nju-dlco-lecture

My solutions for [DLCO(Digital Logic and Computer Organization) lecture](https://nju-projectn.github.io/dlco-lecture-note/) assignments of NJU-ProjectN.

DLCO is the bridging course for Project YSYX.

Each lab eventually runs on NVBoard(another sub-project of NJU-ProjectN), a vitual FPGA.
